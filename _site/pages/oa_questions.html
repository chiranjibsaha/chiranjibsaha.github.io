  <h2>Open Access Policy: Anticipated questions </h2>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span12">
    <p>The
<a href="https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/">University Library Committee</a>
at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>
has formed a working group to develop an Open Access Policy for
UW–Madison, through which university researchers would give
UW–Madison the right to freely distribute pre-prints of all
published journal articles.</p>

<p>The following is a list of anticipated questions about the proposed
policy, and our responses.</p>

<p>The University of California has an excellent
<a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/policy-faq/">FAQ</a>
regarding its policy, as does the
<a href="http://policy.umn.edu/research/scholarlyarticles-faq">University of Minnesota</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Why are you proposing such a policy?</strong></em></p>

    <p>The broad availability of the products of university research is in
keeping with the <a href="http://wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Idea</a> that
“the university should improve people’s lives beyond the classroom.”
The distribution of copies of research articles through a university
repository will make these works available to researchers and the
general public, who may not have access to the scholarly journals in
which they appear.</p>

    <p>In addition, we hope that our efforts to enact this policy will
raise university researchers’ awareness of the rights that they are
relinquishing, and the ways in which they may reserve some of those
rights, when they transfer copyright of their work to publishers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Will the policy prevent me from publishing in journal ____________________?</strong></em></p>

    <p>No. Certain publishers may require that you obtain a policy waiver for
your article. For example, the University of California, which
adopted a <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/">similar policy</a>,
<a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/publisher-communications/">lists publishers for which UC authors have requested waivers</a>,
including Nature Publishing Group, Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS).</p>

    <p>But such waivers will be approved without question, and so you can
continue to publish your work in such journals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>What will I have to do in order to make my article available in the
university repository?</strong></em></p>

    <p>As much as possible, repository staff will identify and capture
relevant articles, in which case you will not need to take any
additional action.</p>

    <p>In addition, there will be a short web-based form though which you
may provide the university repository with a copy of your
article. If your article is already available in an open access
repository, such as
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>, or if it is
openly available at the journal’s site, you may simply provide a
link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>What will I have to do in order to opt out for a particular
article?</strong></em></p>

    <p>There will be a short web-based form through which you may notify
the university that you wish to opt out of the Open Access Policy
for a particular article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Will I need to pay to make my article available through this
policy?</strong></em></p>

    <p>No. While some publishers charge open access fees, you will not need to
pay those fees in order to make your article available in the
university repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Do I need to get my coauthors’ approval?</strong></em></p>

    <p>No. Under US copyright law, each author has the right to distribute
the work, and this may be transferred to the university repository.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
