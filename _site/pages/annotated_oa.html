    <p>In order to have a better sense of what an Open Access policy for
UW-Madison might look like, I looked at the formal policies for several
universities and provide the main components below, with quotes from
the various policies.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be better to say “deconstructed” rather than “annotated”.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Authors affected by the policy <em>may</em> take action individually to
make their work available to the public via the University Digital
Conservancy or other non-profit open-access repositories.”</li>
      <li>“However, authors affected by the policy are not required to take
individual action to make their works available in a non-profit
open-access repository. They may alternatively take advantage of
the active support services provided by the University Libraries.”</li>
      <li>“The University Libraries, at the direction of the Provost’s
Office, will provide active support services such as
identification of eligible articles and communications with
Faculty members about their options for achieving public access
via the University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy or other
non-profit open-access repositories. This process will include
communication with authors, including multiple opportunities for
authors to choose <em>not</em> to share their works or to request an
automatic waiver of the University’s license.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>U Kansas: “faculty members will provide bibliographic information
and an electronic copy of each article within 30 days of publication
to the Provost’s Designate.”</li>
  <li>U Cal:
    <ul>
      <li>“Faculty commit to helping the University obtain copies of the
articles.”</li>
      <li>“each Faculty member who does not
permanently waive the license above will provide an electronic
copy of his or her final version of the article to the University
of California by the date of its publication, for inclusion in an
open access repository.”</li>
      <li>“When appropriate, a Faculty member may
instead notify the University of California if the article will be
freely available in another repository or as an open-access
publication.”</li>
      <li>“Faculty members who have permanently waived the
license may nonetheless deposit a copy with the University of
California or elsewhere for archival purposes.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="periodic-review-of-policy">Periodic review of policy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>U Minn: “The policy will be reviewed after three years and a report
presented to the faculty.”</li>
  <li>U Kansas: “This policy will be reviewed by Faculty Governance, in
concert with the Provost’s office, every three years, and a report
presented to Faculty Governance.”</li>

review the policy within three years, and present a report to the
Faculty and the University of California.”</li>
</ul>
