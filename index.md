I am a PhD student at [Wireless@VT](https://wireless.vt.edu/),  [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.vt.edu/) in [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). My research is supervised by [Dr. Harpreet S. Dhillon](http://www.dhillon.ece.vt.edu/). My dissertation topic is "Advances in Stochastic Geometry for Cellular Networks". My research interst is developing mathematically tractable models of cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry. These models are used to analytically characterize the key performance metrics (like *coverage* and *data rate*). In particular, I developed spatial models of cellular networks using *cluster processes* which closely replicates the *hotspots* in a network with high data demands. I have also worked on modeling and analysis of *millimeter wave integrated access and backhaul networks* which is a new design paradigm of the emerging 5G cellular networks. 
 In summer 2018, I was an intern in [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) where I  explored the beam-tracking performances of mm-wave base stations in urban enviromentments.  In summer 2019, I interned with [Samsung Research America](https://www.sra.samsung.com/) and worked on indoor localization.

Alongside my research, I am a photography-enthusiast. I love to spend time reading and talking about cameras, lights and post-processing. Here's a link to my small gallery.
